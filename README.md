# Week-09
In this week we discussed about the Feed Forward Neural Networks which is a type of supervised Neural Networks.

Refer 3.0 MNIST dataset overview.ipynb and 3.1 FFNN for MNIST dataset.ipynb which are not discussed in the class. MNIST digits dataset has 70,000 handwritten digits (28x28 pixel size) altogether, where 60,000 are for training and 10,000 are for testing.
In 3.1 FFNN for MNIST dataset.ipynb, a simple FFNN type nueral network is implemented to identify handwritten digits using MNIST dataset, which gives more than 98% accuracy after 5 epochs.
